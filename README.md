# AccesAI: AI-Powered Accessibility Enhancement

## Overview
AccesAI is an AI-driven accessibility enhancement tool designed to identify and resolve common accessibility issues on websites. By leveraging computer vision, web scraping, and AI models, AccesAI ensures websites are more inclusive for individuals with disabilities. The tool analyzes website elements like HTML structure, CSS styles, and visual content to detect and fix problems such as missing alt texts, unclear labels, and poor color contrast.

## Features
### 1. Website Analysis
- **HTML and CSS Parsing:** Analyzes the HTML structure and CSS styles of a website.
- **Accessibility Issue Identification:** Detects missing alt texts, unclear labels, and inadequate color contrast.
- **Web Scraping:** Utilizes libraries like BeautifulSoup and Puppeteer to gather webpage content for analysis.

### 2. Accessibility Issue Detection
- **AI Model Integration:** Detects issues using pre-trained AI models.
  - Missing or incomplete alt text for images.
  - Unlabeled or unclear labels for form fields and interactive elements.
  - Poor color contrast between text and background.
- **Flagging System:** Flags accessibility issues for remediation.

### 3. Automatic Remediation
- **HTML and CSS Code Generation:** Automatically generates improved code to fix identified issues.
  - Adds descriptive alt text for images.
  - Enhances labels for form fields and interactive elements.
  - Improves color contrast to meet WCAG standards.
- **Manual Override:** Provides an option for developers to review and tweak the automated fixes.

### 4. Visual Validation
- **Computer Vision System:** Compares screenshots of the original and modified websites.
- **Validation Metrics:** Uses few-shot learning to set thresholds for visual comparison.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison:** Displays original and improved website versions to ensure accessibility improvements without compromising design.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- Libraries and frameworks:
  - BeautifulSoup
  - Puppeteer
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch
  - OpenCV

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AccesAI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AccesAI
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the application and input the URL of the website to analyze.
2. View the detected accessibility issues in the dashboard.
3. Review and apply suggested fixes automatically or manually.
4. Use the visual validation feature to compare the original and modified websites.
5. Export the improved HTML and CSS files.

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React-based interface for user interaction.
- **Backend:** Flask/Django for API handling and processing.
- **AI Models:** Pre-trained models for detecting accessibility issues.
- **Database:** SQLite/PostgreSQL for storing analysis results and user data.

## Few-Shot Learning Implementation
- Utilized few-shot learning to establish thresholds for visual comparison metrics.
- Enhanced precision in detecting significant visual changes between original and modified versions.
- Ensured improved accessibility without disrupting the website's design.

## Deliverables
- Complete web application with the following features:
  - Accessibility issue detection.
  - Automatic remediation with manual override.
  - Visual validation system.
- Exportable reports of identified issues and implemented fixes.
